This week I've decided to do two things. First was to pretty up any exsisting project. I would then start creating a professional portfolio to go along with my projects, resume etc. 

1. During our time at Flatiron I've mentioned in a blog or two that we were not required to use any CSS in our projects. Our Technical projects were mainly to show off our tech.. With that being said the majority of mine were great in regards to functionality and working code. I have been wanting to make them a little more user friendly and prettier. Things like buttons, inputs, background images,  and color were a few things I thought can be improved a little bit. 

I could have went with standard CSS. However, I've used Bootstrap in the past and thought that would be a fantastic fit. Simply and easy I could take me projects and make them a little bit better. Two of my projects I updated the inputs to have a cleaner and easier feel. I wasn't happy of the default squared blocky inputs that were relativley small and not lined up correctly. Also my buttons are now have some animation to them when hovering, click etc. ( this can be done with CSS but Bootstrap has default classes for this which is easier). 

Overall the beautfying of my projects has been coming along great and I will continue to make them more presentable in regards to showcasing them in my portfolio. 

2. Now having my projects a little more pleasing I decided to go ahead and make a portfolio.

I decided to go with wordpress because It's a great tool to be able to have on your resume. With almost 30% of websites being used on wordpress you should know it. Even if you don't plan on using it in your career it's a good skill to pick up on. Also in my personal opinion, if you don't plan on having animation, a back end API to store data / use of objects, then wordpress is the way to go. It's easier to skip just basic html and css and go right to wordpress it's quicker and you even get the free domain. If you do plan on having those then JavaScript / React would be the best bet for the front end. With my portfolio being up and running I'm making more and more edits to it and making sure it's ready for any would be employers.
