I have my projects nicely formatted with descriptions on github. Some youtube video demos to make it that much easier to see. However, it would elevate my Web Development progress further if I had a live active portoflio. With that being said I'm in the process of getting one built and using this blog to brain storm on some ideas. 

My project is going to be put on Heroku. I would buy a domain, but it's just easy to get on Heroku and you don't have to worry about any yearly or monthly payments. Your first 5 websites are free!. 

Now that I know where it's going to be located my next step is to figure out exactly how I'm going to make it and with that I have two options. The first is single page application using HTML and CSS (maybe a little JS for flare) and it would be just one long scroll down showing all the subjects, there can be a nav bar that would bring you to the destination on the page since it'll probably be pretty long. That's what I've seen mostly for Entry level / Junior Portfolios. 

The next option I have in mind would be React, nav bar up top that would change the route to each individual section of the single paged application. This would make each page a little more personal because it could be the only thing you'd see. However, I feel that makes alot of effort for the views needing to use the nav bar. This is supposed to be a quick portoflio site so i'll prob go with the HTML,CSS,JS route. 

Overall I'm excited to build the portoflio and get it up on Heroku. It'll help even showcase my github and social media.
