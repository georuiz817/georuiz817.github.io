It's crazy to think that I have exactly one week left of actual learning. Once Redux is complete it's off to my project / review.  Knowing this it's got me thinking of the project and how my React lesson went. 

I would say in my personal opinion React has been the most fun and interesting lessons to learn. React itself is pretty fun due to the fact that it has html,css, containers and other things to play around with. So having all this at our fingertips we were really able to get a great introduction of it all. 

The lessons weren't filled with confusing labs, or unecessary headaches. They were straight to the point and got right into everything we needed to learn in order to complete the labs and ultimatley our project. 

After completing this section and knowing how close I am to the finish line, I even decided to go back and look around at somethings from 5 months ago that we learned.  It's funny now going back and seeing how simple those things are to me now, when they use to be the most confusin things no earth. I'm hopeful Redux is similar and is not a step back on how great the lessons have been going. Only time will tell!
