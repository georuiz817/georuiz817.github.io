Being on my third week of my job search. I wanted to stray away from working on old projects and try something new. Most importantly something I've never worked with. Search bars / filters! 

Now I have worked with React.js and Rails. However, implementing a search bar is something I haven't gotten to dip my feet into espicially when it's in regards to state. So that's what I'm going for this week on a project. A React front end with a Rails/SQL backend. My idea is that a user can search up an animal and they will get the group name ex. gaggle of geese. 

Now working with state is on the front end and a simple scaffold for the back. But I wanted to make sure I can show off some SQL competency so instead of grabbing everything from an outside api or scraping a site, I'm just going in and seeding in some data. It'll be easy and will help me keep that SQL flow going. 

Now although the project is going to be single paged and could probably do with just regular JS. I wanted to use state. React is something I've been enjoying and want to make sure I keep state fresh in my memory. Maybe at some point Redux can jump in as well. Maybe I'll implment another search bar that requires another componenet and state and we can conslidate it all into a store. 

The project is failry new so I'm hoping to see what hurdles come with it. I'll be making sure to check out a bunch of articles in the mean time!
