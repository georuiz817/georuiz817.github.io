During my job search I've been using the resume instructions and template given to me during my time at Flatiron. No luck with the job search so far, I've decided to update my resume. I HATE google docs for resume building which was the platform I was instructed to use. So I've thrown that way of making one into the trash. My resume seemed a bit dull and like every other Flatiron grads (all my classmates used it, I've seen it on peoples linkedins that were Flatiron Alums). I decided to use the canva platform for a few reasons. 

1. A list of templates to gain inspiration from 
2. The ability to easily change colors, color themes, and insert images, emojis etc. 
3. The spacing, grid, and evenly space and lining up sytem is far better than google docs 
4. Overall easier to use and gives you more options with less annoying margin errors, things moving when you didn't want them to, and spacing issues that comes with google docs. 

With this new tool I went about making my new resume. Still using the same information from my old one, which was fine, I needed to have a new layout and story to tell through the UI. I needed to be colorful to express myself and not just a white and black text resume, It needed to be a bit funky, and it needed to have the use of emojis! 

Now, after some hard work and research my resume is completed and ready to be given out to jobs. My colors are what I wanted gray,dakrblue,lightblue, I found some funky emojis to throw in there to match the theme of my projects, and I trully believe it will make me stand out a bit more compared to everyone else who is using a similar layout from there Flatiron career guide and everyone else who just googled how to make a resume. It's a bit more personable. 

I'd suggest any student to do this with canva ASAP before they even start there official career search. Don't fall into the trap of making a boring resume!
