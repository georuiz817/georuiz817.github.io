I have a full functional created portoflio with Wordpress. However, I wanted to challenge my self further and incorporate animation and have more control of a personalized theme that really represents me. That's why I've decided to make one from scratch. 

I'm currently using a few tools to make the project. Mainly React, Sass, and some other interesting libraries I will be incorporating. Overall I can already tell the ability to freely code is making the portoflio move quicker and making it more interesting to a visitor. 

The theme I'm using is a old MS DOS based system. It's going to look very old and work very similar to a old DOS computer (I'll make sure users can click though, don't want it to feel too old!). 

Sass is coming very handy during this process. Having multiple boxes to represent a computer screen, computer hardware and backgrounds  is becoming very challenging. The pre-processor is a life saver. 

The React componenets are piling up so I'm going to as well do some research on good layouts for a project in regards to the files. Right now they're all just dumped into a components folder. Maybe they'll need to be spread out to ones that hold state, and functionals. 

I'll be giving another update in regards to the portoflio project with React soon and will have it on my resume and social media once completed!
