Now that my most recent project Retro Pad has been completed. I'm looking into exactly what I'd love to do next. A part of my wants to jump right back into React. However, I believe I should do one of two things. 

1. Just do a straight up HTML CSS project. Go back to the bare essentials and keep practicing them. Yes, apart of a Web Dev is to also use functions and other tools to make beautiful websites and applications. But I feel that more I do it the more I find myself quickly having sloppy html code. It can be hard to have a good layout and once functions and components are thrown into the mix it can get sloppy fast. I believe a regular ole HTML CSS project will give me the ability to practice the bare essentials without having to worry about other things like functions. Maybe a restaurant site? Or a retali store site? 

2. My second idea would be to use a tool I've never made a project with. I have the ability to use Vue.js so maybe I can make a first project with it. Or maybe Node.js and make some type of text adventure game. The options are limitless so it would be valuable to do so. Instead of having employers seeing just React projects maybe a new tool thrown into the mix would help. It would show I'm verstile with multiple tools and can learn and adapt to a new one quickly.
