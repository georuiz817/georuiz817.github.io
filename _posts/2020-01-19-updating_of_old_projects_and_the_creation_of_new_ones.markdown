while I'm currently applying to companies  (few phone interviews / upcoming in-person ones) I've decided to continue to work on projects (duh). I created my animal searcher for phone and refreshed my skills on React/APis and even learned a new one about search bars. However, while I can keep making new projects I wanted to go back and fix a few of my old ones I learned during Flatiron. 

Flatiron's portfolio projects they made us use clearly were very important. We would not of done the projects if they weren't. That's why I made it a point to go back and make a few edits. 

Upgrading the CSS is must. That wasn't so much of a requirement in our projects. So making them look like a new fresh was something I wanted to do. Also not only thing but changing some architecture. I made sure that  some of my projects were one master file/branch making it easier to at to heroku at a later time. I also wanted to make sure in React, all my imports were not coming directly from  the file source name, but used in a format that any one can just clone and use like ./functionals/homepage.js format. 

Finally I added some READMES. They are very important. If your projects are not on heroku it's important that anyone can just clone them. I made sure to add detailed insturctions making it quick and easy to clone and go. 

Overall I think my projects can always be expanded and upgraded on and I will continue to do so.These were just a few things I touched upon. I will even be making some more!
