Three weeks into my search and I've already gotten some emails / call backs! It's a good learning process to be able to see how tech recruiters and employees respond / see what they're looking for. With that being said I expect to see alot more in the upcoming weeks. One thing I hope to see being mentioned or look at is my completed Animal Filter project! 

Now that Animal Filter is completed I can reflect on exactly the process I went through:

1. Set up Rails API with SQLite (manually seeded in all animal groups) 
2. React Front End with great html / css and fetch'd data from api 
3. search bar with a "searched" state and a all animals array (fetch'd animal api info) 
4. dispayed search results properties based off searched result 

It was fun making a search bar for the first time. I've done some step by steps during Flatiron but this was the first time with react and the first time manually doing it. I'd love to get some cooler designs within the search bar as well. 

Now that I have another project under my belt I'm hopful that everywhere I'm hearing back from will be good results!
