This is the second week of my career journey. Not only have I applied to places, but I've connected and worked on projects. It's deff a  struggle but I am sure I can get through it. 

So far I've been working on technical projects during the mean time. One project I am working hard on is Animal_DB. I wqnt to have a SQLite3 DB that holds a great deal of animal group names - ex: gaggle of geese. this will then let a user see what a specific animal group name is. I orginally wanted to make it a single paged html project with a rails db. But i've sinced pivoted to a rails and React project. The reason why I pivoted is because I personally enojoy manipulating state and using react instead of just vanilla JS.

However, it's become a challange. I'm researching how to take a state array and filter search through it. Their are so much articles and websites on this. However, I think I will go with my own code and put my own flare to it. Regardless it's difficult. Not only this but I want to make sure the UI is great. In that case, the CSS needs to be perfect. I did do a mock interview recenty and was given a fantastic CSS website to learn from so I'm making sure to follow that. 

I can't wait to see what week 3 of my career journey entails. I'm sure there will be road bumps and challenges. But, if Flatiron taught me one thing it was to challenge myself and power through any obsitcal.
