After taking a short project break, I've decided to keep working and get it done ASAP. In my app the address book is completley done. Users can create, view, and delete addresses. The next process I'm going through is the memos. Users should have the ability to jot done memos in a note pad. It will be very similar to addresses as it will have all the similar functions. The structure of the files will be set up similar as well as the code itself. However, different key words and different UX of memos is very important. 

This time it's not just a list of address properties. It's a long memo paragraph that a user will read like a story. Making sure the appropriate amount of words are on a given line needs to be done due to the screen being so small. The project is bound to the size of the Pilot. To have a good UX it shouldn't be squished words that are hard to read or are cut off. This is something I will be noting and taking care of throughout working on the memos. Perhaps I will be making the words smalller compared to the address book? 

Besides Memos, a Todo list will also be put in. What I'm going to try and do with the Todos is make it so a user can delete it from their list and mark it complete. It will also have all the Create,Index,Delete actions. But ultimatley have a To Do history so a user can see all their todos and see when they've infact completed it. So in this case it's being deleted off the to do list but not from the database.
